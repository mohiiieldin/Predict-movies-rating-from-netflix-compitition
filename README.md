### Introduction
This project aims to predict for each movie what is the rate using RMSE as a metric for evaluating the model.
Users were selected at random for inclusion. All users selected had rated at least 20 movies. Unlike previous MovieLens data sets, no demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

#### Goal
The goal is to train a machine learning algorithm using the inputs of a provided training subset to predict movie ratings in a validation set and score RMSE less than 0.86499

#### Dataset
The MovieLens dataset can be downloaded from thins link https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/ After some preprocessing we have 2 data sets 1) edx which is the main train data that consists of 6 columns and +9 milion row 2) test which is the data that we will validate our model performance using it, Consists of 6 columns and 999999 row

#### Tools used
I used kaggle kernal as my machine resources is not enought to handle a big data set like this so all model fitting and experimentation was made on it as it gives me 4 cores and 16 gega RAM
